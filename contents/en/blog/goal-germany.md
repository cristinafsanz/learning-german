  Why I am starting this blog? To document how I re-learn German again for a trip to Germany in May 2020.

## Why writing this blog?

Years ago I was living in Germany and I learnt quite German there, but speaking has been hard for me. Next year I come back there to visit a friend and I would like to speak with them and understand them, if possible.

So I will start learning German again and I will document here what I am learning and the sources I find to do it, mostly with films and series, would it be possible to achieve?

To be continue...
